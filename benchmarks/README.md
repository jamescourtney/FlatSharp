This folder contains FlatSharp benchmarks. These are "living" benchmarks, so old versions of FlatSharp are run against new Benchmarks that are defined later, when possible. 
These folders contain the outputs of a specific version of FlatSharp's benchmark results. So, the ```3.0.0``` folder contains the raw data for the benchmark run that used 
FlatSharp version 3.0.0. These benchmarks are also maintained in a set of OneDrive spreadsheets available at these links:
