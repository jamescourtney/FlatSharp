/// <summary>
/// Beginning in FlatSharp version 5.7.0, FlatBuffer structs can be declared as value types (ie, C# structs).
/// Value types offer many advantages, such as reduced garbage collection and predictable memory layouts for interop.
/// 
/// However, value structs are not as fully featured as reference structs and can require some care when programming. 
/// In particular, the following are unsupported:
/// - Deserialization modes (value structs are individually deserialized greedily).
/// - IFlatBufferDeserializedObject and other convenience interfaces.
/// 
/// However, Value Structs offer some compelling advantages over reference type structs:
/// - Serialization and parsing can be done with a memcopy operation (on little-endian architectures) instead of field-by-field.
/// - They do not incur any GC allocations, though large structs may take longer to copy.
/// - They can be used for P/Invoke interop with other languages.
/// 
/// The Struct Vectors sample has examples of using struct vectors with value-type structs.
/// </summary>

        // Points[4] will not be read until that index is accessed.
